//Hunter is one of the leading scientists onboard Endeavor,
and oversees all ongoing projects. This often leaves him
audibly tired, he speaks slowly, and with a fairly
monotonous tone. Being a man of science and high education,
he does make a point to note every last detail, even when
it bores him to say so. The current Saturn excavation does
hold a slight interest, and he is keeping tabs on it,
in the hopes of a discovery to negate the dullness
of being in a space station for months on end.

Log transcript below:

"This is Dr. Hunter, project manager of the science team onboard
Endeavor."

"It is currently the fifth of May," [pauses to check watch] "2120,
17 hours and 30 minutes."

"We've conducted more tests on the artifacts recovered from Saturn,
and have made significant progress on the scanning of
these alien objects."

"I have found traces of living cells on a damaged artifact."

It would seem these cells have resided in the objects for [pause]...
...hundreds of years, perhaps even thousands."

"There [emphasis] is visible erosion on the objects, as if they were rocks,
however the profile of these objects is too discrete to be natural,
in our understanding of the word, of course."

"The damaged artifact appears to have corroded from inside,
I suggest that cells have eaten away at the material, but
we won't have conclusive evidence until we've identified
similar activity in our other specimens."

"There are no cells to be observed from the damaged objects,
but we are expecting to have greater success when..."

"...if we can open one of the other objects."
