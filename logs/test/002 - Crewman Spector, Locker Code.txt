This is Spector. I'm an engineer onboard a trash can in space,
and some wiseass demanded that I had to document all future
notes with this PDA.

It's currently the eighteenth of may, twenty-one twenty, and I'm
bored shitless in this post. The ship I'm in is a cargo frigate,
the Trojan. Stupid name if you ask me. We're bound to Saturn
for some kind of cargo pickup from a research station. Something
about some fancy looking rocks or stone-age artifacts. I don't
understand why anyone would go looking for some wretched
egyption objects halfway across the star system but I guess it
pays well or something.

Some of the other workers on the engineer deck keep losing their
tools or dropping them through the floor. They always come
whining to me about it, so I threw all of the spares in a locker.
The code to get in is 451.

I shouldn't have to babysit the handling of our equipment,
but some folks are just helpless I guess. I can't wait to get
off this piece of junk.
