Working directory/git repository for Xenotomb. (Codenamed XIIX for "Xenotomb (18)")
Project lead and primary mapper and designer is Neo "Neonspider" Te-Aika.
Additional design, mapping, and advanced programming by Joseph "(insert)" Sutton.

More detailed credits are in respective directories within Xenotomb.

This directory is created to be compiled into an .ipk3 for use with GZDoom as an
"IWAD". Xenotomb is a standalone game for GZDoom, it doesn't require a copy
of a Doom engine game to run and will have its own planned addons in the future.

Xenotomb is built upon a specific build of GZDoom. We will always migrate to
the newest devbuild that doesn't introduce any known bugs that would affect
our project. 

Xenotomb is currently powered by: "GZDoom-g3.4pre-392-gba9a340c1-x64"

The release version will ship as an .IPK3, and a standalone build with a custom
build of GZDoom. Be sure you use the above "powered by" build or newer to play.

You are free to investigate or play our current state of Xenotomb, but it isn't
ready for release. Please don't publicly discuss or reveal our project to the
masses until its planned announcement thread releases on the ZDoom forums in June. :)
