The plan is to release a three level build when we announce the project
to show an idea of what our game will be. Each level will have some distinct
differences and showcase various elements of our game.

A10 - The 'first level' of the game, introducing the plot and gameplay. Indoors.

B10 - Low gravity section, set on the exterior of the spaceship. Outdoor combat.

WS10 - Zombies/Horde style wave survival map on an alien moon (Titan).

Useable weapons include the Baton, Pistol, and SMG in A10, Baton Pistol and
Autogun in B10, and the Baton, Pistol and Shotgun in S10.
